# Snowstorm Game Engine

If God permits this will one day be a full-fledged Vulkan game engine.

There are two included projects - one called _Core_, and one called _App_. [Premake](https://github.com/premake/premake-core) is used to generate project files.

Core builds into a static library and is meant to contain common code intended for use in multiple applications. App builds into an executable and links the Core static library, as well as provides an include path to Core's code.

The `Scripts/` directory contains build scripts for Windows and Linux, and the `Vendor/` directory contains Premake binaries (currently version `5.0-beta2`).
